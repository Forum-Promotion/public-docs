# Posting Packages

The Forum Promotion Package Service is an easy way to grow activity on your forum or blog. Our Package Team Members (PTMs) will make posts on your forum or blog, to both make your site more active, and to also build content so that other members will find your site more appealing. Posting Packages can be redeemed for FP Cash, which is earned by posting around Forum Promotion.

**How to Request a Package.** To request a package, simply go to the Package Request Forum and [create a new topic](https://community.forumpromotion.net/forums/posting-packages.6/create-thread). There is a brief template which you will need to fill out first, which asks you the Website URL, Package Type, Package Upgrade, and Additional Information. Please make sure to read the [Package Service Guidelines](https://community.forumpromotion.net/threads/requesting-packages-information.167344/) before requesting.

**Which Package Should I Choose?** The package team offers a good variable of packages. The best choice for your forum depends on how large your forum is, and how much FP cash you have available to spend.

For Forums, we offer:

*   **Garnet Package:** This package is good for new members here on FP. It is a nice way to get a feel for how things work. You will receive three threads and two replies on your forum from one PTM.
*   **Emerald Package:** The next step up. You will receive six threads and ten replies on your forum from two PTMs.
*   **Ruby Package:** You will receive twelve threads and twenty-one replies on your forum from three PTMs.
*   **Jadeite Packge:** Our newest one. You will receive sixteen threads and twenty-eight replies on your forum from four PTMs.

For Blogs, we offer:

*   **Marble Package:** Just like with the Garnet for forums, this is great for those who are new to increase activity on a blog. You will receive three comments on your blog from one PTM.
*   **Obsidian Package:** Our middle package. You will receive ten comments on your blog from two PTMs.
*   **Feldspar Package:** Our newest one. You will receive fifteen comments on your blog from three PTMs.

**Tips for Using the Package Service**

*   **Reply to posts:** Once the package team is done posting on your forum, we recommend that you reply to the posts they made. That makes your forum even more active, because not only is the package team participating, but you as well.
*   **Upgrades are available for additional fees.** Members can choose from having all Replies, all Threads, requesting certain areas as well as specific PTMs they would like to complete their package.
